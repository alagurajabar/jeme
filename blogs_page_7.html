      Have you ever felt like having a lump in your throat and used your smile as a shield for hiding it?<br><br>
Are you still weeping for the things that left you?<br><br>
At some point, have you ever felt that your life seems to be meaningless or boring or an empty cup?<br><br>
Have you ever felt that there is no one to love you in this world?<br><br>
Are you frustrated with the unexpected results?<br><br>
<br><br>
When millions and millions of unanswered questions encircling within you start to fight with your brain and heart and create a cold war with powerful thoughts as the sword.<br><br> This battle will end up in a volcanic eruption by decimating some portions of your heart with the void and left you with lava from your eyes.<br><br>
This eruption will be overflown when you try to fill the void with creations and not with the creator or rushing for things that need its own pace to grow.
<br><br>
Have you ever picturised and felt gratitude in your heart for the creator for creating you as a fearfully wonderfully made masterpiece?<br><br>
Remember this void is the cause of your negative opinion that you have on yourself and your life.<br><br>
Here is a tiny magic filled with ink to fill the void in you.... yes " the PEN"
<br><br>
First, take a deep breathe and pen down all the worthy things you have in your life and take some seconds to put all things into a beautiful picture:
<br><br>
You can wake up from your bed daily under the comfortable shelter which protects in the sun and rain  but on other side refugees thrash between one place to other...You can inhale the fresh oxygen, but on the other side some people crave to breathe with ventilators..You can observe the things through your eyes, but on the other side vision is only a dream , Your ears are capable of hearing and your hands and the legs can do anything you wish and most importantly you are "alive" in this moment.
Isn't a great thing to be celebrated and to be thankful for?
<br><br>
You never gifted anything to the creator for the unconditional loving and caring mother who even feed you like a 2 months old baby..for the father, who sacrificed his life and supported you in all your hurdles with the ever-smiling lips...<br><br>for the ever notorious brothers and sisters who are always there to put and prevent you on fires, for the grandparents who get scolded for always standing beside you for the crimes you did and the ever-loving family, I mean the friends you earn in your life.
Have you ever thought that these are the things which many people in the Earth can only dream of?
<br><br>
So,fill the void with the worthy things around you and those will make you realise that these are not worthy enough to create eruption and reminds you that  "right things will hitch you at the right time!"
<br><br>
When Being alive is a special occasion nowadays,so stop weeping and complaining and start to thank and cherish the moments with the things you are blessed with and there will be no space for the void in your heart.
When your heart feels overwhelmed with the thanksgiving greetings to the creations of the creator ,you feel complete and you can now start to fill empty cups around you.
<br><br>
I  wish love, smile, and happiness to be overwhelmed from your cup.
